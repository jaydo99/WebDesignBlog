  <h1> Why is git so useful? </h1>
    <p> Git can be a useful tool for designers in many environments and circumstances. Firstly, Git is a distributed version-control system code. Therefore, it allows you store and work on multiple versions of the same code, creating security and flexibility when working on code. Git tackles the problem of editing your code to a point of error without reverse. Instead, git tracks and saves stages of your code base, allowing you to access history of the code and easily go back on undesired changes. Therefore, the editing of codebases is much less risky when using git. This feature would be a huge benefit to a group of designers wanting to create a short-notice website redesign prototype as it would allow them to work freely, with the ability to make changes which can easily be managed and reversed. Git also allows for branching capabilities when working towards a master code. Therefore, several branches can be made to work on the code, while the master code remains live and running. This would allow the team to work on the website, while keeping the existing website up and running while these changes are being made. Git also allows a group of people to work together in an organized and collaborative way which is highly useful in a group situation.

<h1> Wireframes </h1>
<img class="wireframe" src="./images/wireframe.jpg">
<p> Before I looked at any elements of coding, I began the process by roughly sketching out wireframe concepts for the blog, which were very basic but easy to comprehend. This served as a visual guide to assist in creating the blog. When designing the look of my blog, I wanted to create something that looked very minimal and clean. I knew I wanted alot of whitespace to so and therefore I designed around using wide margins for the content. I also wanted to keep the colours very minimal and tidy.
